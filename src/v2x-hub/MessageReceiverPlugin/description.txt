The MessageReceiverPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that accepts incoming SAE J2735 MAP Messages 
on a UDP port and publishes that message through the V2I Hub system for other plugins to use.

\section messagercvrdesign Description

Most DSRC RSUs have an application that forwards certain messages from the radio to a configured device. The stored data is sent in J2735 2016 
format, and the most common data type sent is the BSM.  The Message Receiver Plugin was written to take the forwarded J2735 2016 messages such 
as BSM from an RSU and send it into the V2I Hub system for other applications, like the CSW plugin, to use in its processing. The Message Receiver 
can work with any device that forwards J2735 messages or V2I Hub JSON encoded messages over UDP, including simulation software or future 
communication devices which support the same standard. Indeed, this plugin is used to receive the simulated BSMs and SRMs coming from the V2I Hub 
Vehicle Simulation Tool. See the V2I Hub Vehicle Simulation Tool User Guide for more details.  

\section messagercvrconfig Configuration

The configuration of the Message Receiver plugin requires only the IP address for the V2I Hub device receiving the messages to be set for the IP 
configuration value, along with the Port to open on that V2I Hub device. The plugin is already set up to receive J2735 2016 messages from any number 
of 4.1 compliant RSUs or simulation software, but those RSUs and the simulation software must separately be configured with these IP and Port values 
to route the incoming messages directly to the V2I Hub Message Receiver Plugin. The RouteDSRC flag is used for simulation testing in the lab and 
allows BSMs generated by other plugins to also be sent out of the RSU. This configuration values should not be changed and kept at false for most 
tests and for all deployments. There are also three configuration parameters for accepting BSM and/or SRM messages from the V2I Hub Vehicle Simulation 
Tool. Incoming BSMs from the simulation software can also be used to create simulated GPS locations.

- IP: IP address for the incoming message network connection.  The default value only accepts connection from the localhost, and must be changed to receive from external subnets.
- Port: Port for the RSU network connection
- RouteDSRC: Set flag to true for the message to be sent out the DSRC radio by the DSRC Message Manager. This flag would only be used in testing or simulation.  For example, having an RSU broadcast BSMs from simulation software.
- EnableSimulatedBSM: Accept and route incoming BSM messages from a V2I Hub Vehicle Simulation Tool.
- EnableSimulatedSRM: Accept and route incoming SRM messages from a V2I Hub Vehicle Simulation Tool.
- EnableSimulatedLocation: Accept and route incoming GPS location messages from a V2I Hub Vehicle Simulation Tool.
