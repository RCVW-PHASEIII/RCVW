\tableofcontents

The SpatPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that publishes a SAE J2735 SPaT Message containing 
data to describe the current signal, phase and timing of the signal controller at an intersection. 

\section spatdesign Description

The Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) plugin communicates with the traffic signal controller (TSC) and 
creates J2735 SPaT messages conforming to the J2735 2016 format. The communication with the traffic 
signal controller is done using NTCIP communication over UDP receiving a bit encoded byte array. The SPaT 
plugin only sends the necessary message to the TSC to enable and disable the sending of the UDP bit encoded 
stream. This plugin’s main function is to receive the UDP bit encoded stream from the TSC and create the 
J2735 SPaT message.

\section spatconfig Configuration

The SPaT plugin can be configured communicate and receive signal phase and timing information from a single 
traffic signal controller. 

The SignalGroupMapping contains a list of active phases from the signal controller and their corresponding signal 
groups in the J2735 SPaT message along with their phase type of either vehicle, pedestrian or overlap. Each intersection 
can be given a friendly name to include in the description of the SPaT message. The Intersection_Name configuration 
value contains the information that will be populated into that description. The Local_IP configuration value contains 
the local IP address of the V2I Hub on the same network as the traffic signal controller. This is the same IP address 
that you would use to configure the traffic signal controller as the endpoint to send the UDP SPaT stream. Paired with 
the Local_IP is the Local_UDP_Port. This is the port on the local V2I Hub used to receive the UDP SPaT stream.  For most 
of the traffic signal controllers, this is either a non-configurable value set to 6053, or a configurable value 
defaulted to 6053. This configuration value should not need to be modified for the SPaT plugin to operate correctly. The 
last two configuration values, TSC_IP and TSC_Remote_SNMP_Port, are used by the V2I Hub to send Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. The TSC_IP address contains the IP address of the TSC. The port for which the TSC 
listens for SNMP commands is configured by the TSC_Remote_SNMP_Port. Again, the default for the TSC_Remote_SNMP_Port 
shouldn’t need to be modified.

- Intersection_Id: The intersection id for SPaT generated by this plugin.
- Intersection_Name: The intersection name for SPaT generated by this plugin.
- SignalGroupMapping: JSON data defining a list of active SignalGroups and phases. 
	Ex {"SignalGroups":[{"SignalGroupId":1,"Phase":1,"Type":"vehicle"},{"SignalGroupId":2,"Phase":2,"Type":"vehicle"},{"SignalGroupId":22,"Phase":2,"Type":"pedestrian"}]}
- Local_IP: The IPv4 address of the local computer for receiving Traffic Signal Controller Broadcast Messages.
- Local_UDP_Port: The local UDP port for reception of Traffic Signal Controller Broadcast Messages from the TSC.
- TSC_IP: The IPv4 address of the destination Traffic Signal Controller (TSC).
- TSC_Remote_SNMP_Port: The destination port on the Traffic Signal Controller (TSC) for SNMP NTCIP 1202 v2 communication.
