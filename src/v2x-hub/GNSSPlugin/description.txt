The GNSSPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that publishes an internal \ref tmx::messages::LocationMessage "LocationMessage"
built from a connection to a GPSd server.

\section locdesign Description

This plugin provides common access to the Global Positioning System (GPS) location service in the form of a V2I Hub message.  That message
contains the longitude, latitude, altitude and relative speed and heading of the target, that is obtained from an active connection to
the GPSd service running on that target.  Note that this is mostly useful for on-board units that are moving, however it is also required
in order to pass location information to an NTRIP caster for RTCM corrections.  The GPSd service need not be the same localhost that the  
plugin is running on, but also can be located on any system on the network, such as a nearby RSU.

\section locconfig Configuration

The Location plugin must be configured with the source IP of the GPSd service to connect to, plus how frequent the Location  messages are to be 
generated.  In order to support the RTCM plugin, the SendRawNMEA flag must be set to true in order to receive the raw GGA string returned from
the gpsd connection.  Additionally, moving vehicles may lose heading while stopped, so it is important to use the LatchHeadingSpeed value to
set the speed at which no more updates are made to heading.  This should, of course, be set very low. 

- Frequency: Rate to send Location Message in milliseconds.
- GPSSource: Host where the GPSd is running.
- LatchHeadingSpeed: Speed at which the heading parameter should be latched, in mph. Set to 0 to disable latching.
- SendRawNMEA: Route the raw NMEA strings from GPSd through V2I Hub
