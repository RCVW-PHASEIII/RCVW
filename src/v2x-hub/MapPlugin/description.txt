The MapPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that publishes a SAE J2735 MAP Message containing 
data to describe complex intersections, curve outlines, and roadway segments which are used 
by a variety of other J2735 messages.

\section mapdesign Description

The MAP plugin creates J2735 MAP messages in J2735 2016 format. Inputs into the plugin can be created using the Battelle 
MAP Input Tool or U.S. DOTs ISD Message Creator. The V2I Hub MAP Input Tool creates the input into an Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
format that describes the intersection with approach and egress lanes. More information on the XML MAP file format can be found in Appendix D 
of the V2I Hub Plugins document.  The V2I Hub MAP Input Tool is available in the U.S. DOT’s OSADP repository along with documentation on how 
to use the tool to generate inputs for the MAP plugin. The ISD Message Creator 
(<a href="https://webapp.connectedvcs.com/isd/">https://webapp.connectedvcs.com/isd/</a>) is a MAP and SPaT creation tool for intersections in the 
U.S. DOT CV Tools Library (a href="https://webapp.connectedvcs.com/">https://webapp.connectedvcs.com/"</a>). This online tool aids in the 
creation of J2735 2016 MAP files, which can be used as inputs for the V2I Hub MAP plugin. The input needed by the MAP plugin can be created
by using the export tool, setting the Message Type dropdown to MAP, and copying the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) from the MAP Data text 
block into a file with a .json extension. The JSON format is a lightweight data exchange format that is human readable and easy for machines 
to serialize and de-serialize.

\section mapconfig Configuration

The MAP plugin can be configured to send different MAP files based on the action value received by the SPaT plugin. The frequency to which the
MAP Plugin can transmit its output can be configured by the Frequency configuration value, in milliseconds.  The MAP plugin uses a JSON value for 
the configuration key MAP_files which contains the MAP file to load associated with an action id. The action id is associated to an action plan in 
the Traffic Signal Controller (TSC). The SPaT plugin will transmit the current action plan that it retrieves from the TSC to the V2I Hub, where the 
MAP plugin will receive it. The MAP plugin will load the appropriate MAP based on the action id. If an action id is supplied by the SPaT plugin 
doesn’t have a corresponding item in the MAP_Files list, the MAP file associated with the first action 0 will be loaded. 

- Frequency: The frequency to send the MAP message in milliseconds.
- MapFiles: JSON data defining a list of MAP files. One MAP file for each action set specified by the TSC.  Ex: { "MapFiles": [  {"Action":0, "FilePath":"GID_Test.xml"}] }
