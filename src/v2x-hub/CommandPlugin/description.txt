The CommandPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that allows remote administration from the V2I Hub admin portal. 

\section cmddesign Description

The V2I Hub Command Plugin is used solely for communication to and from V2I Hub Admin Portal connections. Using web socket connections from any 
number of browsers, the Command Plugin writes periodic updates to each web portal for display, as well as handling incoming requests for change 
from the administrative users of the web portal. The options include software changes, configuration changes and message and event displays. 
Refer to the V2I Hub Admin Portal Guide for more details.

\section cmdconfig Configuration

The configuration values below are used to set up security and performance of the V2I Hub Command Plugin. The default mode of operation is 
with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) around the web socket connection. This secured web socket mode should always be used in deployment, and the 
appropriate certificates must be installed to the SSLPath location. Because messages are processed in batch by the Command Plugin, the number of 
milliseconds between each cycle will affect both the performance of the plugin and the display update intervals for each of the web portals. The 
DownloadPath is a location where installable components such as new or updated plugins contained in a .zip are temporarily extracted to. Therefore, 
the Linux user running the Command Plugin process must have write permissions to this directory for the feature to work properly.

- SSLEnabled: Enable secure connection using SSL.
- SSLPath: The path to the directory containing the SSL key and certificate files.  The files in this directory should be secured from outside access.
- SleepMS: The length in milliseconds to sleep between processing all messages.
- EventRowLimit: The maximum number of rows returned for the initial Event Log query.
- DownloadPath: The path to the directory where downloaded files will be saved.
