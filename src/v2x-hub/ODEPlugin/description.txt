The ODEPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that forwards J2735 BSM messages from the V2I Hub to the UDP uploader on the ITS JPO ODE server.

\section odedesign Description

The Operational Data Environment (ODE) is a scalable data acquisition and distribution solution created by ITS JPO. The ODE plugin allows 
transmission of BSMs received in the V2I Hub to the deployed ODE solution. In a deployed V2I Hub system, the BSM would be received by the 
RSU and forwarded to the V2I Hub. Once in the V2I Hub, the BSM would be received by the ODE plugin and then sent to the ODE using the set 
configuration. The ODE solution can also create TIM information based on the data it receives. The ODE plugin will query the ODE for TIM 
messages for the deployed V2I Hubâ€™s location, using the latitude and longitude obtained by GPS or set in configuration during deployment. 
Any TIM messages retrieved by the ODE plugin will be packaged and sent through the V2I Hub and ultimately out the RSU.

\section odeconfig Configuration

The ODE Plugin Receiver can be configured to send BSM messages and receive TIM messages from one ODE instance using the configuration below. 
The ODEIP contains the configuration value for the IP address for the deployed ODE, and the ODEPort is the port used for transmission 

- ODEIP: IP address for the ODE network connection.
- ODEPort: Port for the ODE network connection.
