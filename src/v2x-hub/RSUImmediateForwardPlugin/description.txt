\tableofcontents

The DsrcMessageManagerPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that routes J2735 message to a destination RSU radio for broadcast.

\section dsrcmsgmgrdesign Description

The DSRC immediate forward plugin, also known as the DSRC Message Manager, listens for any J2735 Message passing through V2I Hub whose flag
is set to including DSRC routing.  Those messages are then automatically forwarded to the defined destination on a remote RSU.  Note that 
these destinations must adhere to the RSU 4.1 immediate forward specification in order to process the message and broadcast the bytes over
the DSRC radio.  This plugin tracks the number of messages that are successfully or unsuccessfully passed to the RSU.

\section dsrcmsgmgrconfig Configuration

The DSRC Message Manager listens for V2I Hub messages that need to be routed out the DSRC radio, packages the messages, and transmits them to the DSRC 
radio using the Immediate Forward protocol found in the RSU 4.1 specification.  The DSRC Message Manager plugin can be configured to send the messages 
to four different destinations.  A destination is dependent on the type of RSU used.  For example, the Lear RSU must have an immediate forward application 
running for each Provider Service Identifier (PSID) which means to send four different PSIDs to one RSU four different destinations would need to be 
configured to communicate with the four different instances of the immediate forward application running on the Lear RSU.  Another example uses only 
one destination for a Cohda RSU since the Cohda RSU immediate forward application does not limit its inputs based on PSID.

- Message_Destination_1: JSON data defining the message types and PSIDs for messages forwarded to the DSRC radio at destination 1.
- Message_Destination_2: JSON data defining the message types and PSIDs for messages forwarded to the DSRC radio at destination 2.
- Message_Destination_3: JSON data defining the message types and PSIDs for messages forwarded to the DSRC radio at destination 3.
- Message_Destination_4: JSON data defining the message types and PSIDs for messages forwarded to the DSRC radio at destination 4.
- Destination_1: The destination UDP server(s) and port number(s) on the DSRC radio for all messages specified by Messages_Destination_1.
- Destination_2: The destination UDP server(s) and port number(s) on the DSRC radio for all messages specified by Messages_Destination_2.
- Destination_3: The destination UDP server(s) and port number(s) on the DSRC radio for all messages specified by Messages_Destination_3.
- Destination_4: The destination UDP server(s) and port number(s) on the DSRC radio for all messages specified by Messages_Destination_4.
