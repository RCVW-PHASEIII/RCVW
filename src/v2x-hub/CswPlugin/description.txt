The CswPlugin is a plugin for the V2I Hub that generates J2735 TIM Messages for warning of an upcoming curve when an incoming J2735 BSM
Message is received that violates the safe conditions programmed for the curve.  This plugin can also send instructions to the DmsPlugin
in order to post an appropriate warning message to the dynamic message sign.

\section cswdesign Description

The Curve Speed Warning (CSW) plugin transmits information pertaining to an approaching sharp curve, monitors basic safety messages (BSM), 
and requests display of messages on a DMS when conditions are met. The CSW application monitors and transmits geometry leading up to the 
entrance of the curve using four zones.  The zones are transmitted with the recommended speed for each zone using the J2735 TIM messages 
in J2735 2016 format. The zones for the CSW message lead up to the entrance of the curve and are numbered from one to four, with one 
being the closest zone to the entrance of the curve. This means a vehicle driving towards the curve will enter zone four first, then three 
and so on until the vehicle enters the curve. The zones are directional, meaning that the vehicle traveling towards the curve will interact 
with the zones, but the vehicle traveling away from the curve will not. To give CSW alerts in both directions, zones will need to be created 
for each direction of travel. The four zones are used by an in-vehicle application which can give different alerts or warnings to the driver 
depending on zone and speed. When the CSW plugin detects that a BSM is going over the recommended speed in zones three through one, the CSW 
plugin will sending a DMS request to display “Slow Down” on the DMS.

\section cswconfig Configuration

Configuration for the CSW plugin is done using the following configuration values. The frequency of TIM transmission by the CSW plugin can 
be changed using the Frequency configuration values. This value is defaulted to 1000 milliseconds, or one second. The TIM geometry zones 
are configured using the MapFile configuration value. This value points to an xml file on the V2I Hub, in the CSW plugin’s home directory, 
that contains the configuration of the zones in xml format. This xml format is like that of the MAP plugin. The default location for the 
xml file is /var/www/plugings/CswPlugin. More information of the structure of the CSW input xml format can be found in Appendix C of the 
V2I Hub Plugin guide.

Snap Interval and Vehicle Timeout config are used by the vehicle monitoring algorithm portion of the CSW plugin. The CSW will timeout a 
vehicle that it has not received an update from after the value in Vehicle Timeout, which is defaulted to two seconds. The snap interval 
is used to reduce jitter in the GPS position, and requires that 300 milliseconds elapse before transitioning a vehicle out of a zone.

- Frequency: The frequency to send the TIM in milliseconds.
- MapFile: The CSW xml input file.
- Snap Interval: The interval in milliseconds to keep a vehicle within a zone before allowing it to transition out of all zones.
- Vehicle Timeout: Timeout in milliseconds when a vehicle is removed from all zones if a BSM has not been received.
