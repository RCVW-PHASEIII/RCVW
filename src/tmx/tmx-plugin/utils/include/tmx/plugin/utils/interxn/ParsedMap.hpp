/*ParsedMap is a 'smarter' version of the raw MAP data we get from the DSRC data.
 * ParsedMap translates all offsets, computed lanes, and raw points into true lat/longs.

 * Raw MAP data:All geometry points are Cartesian offsets from an intersection reference point that is
given in (Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude) coordinates in the WGS 84 system. This
means that all the points that are used to describe the geometry are described as distance
in decimeters from the intersection reference point (x [decimeters], y [decimeters],
z [decimeters]);
